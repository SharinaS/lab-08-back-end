Notes:
==================
require() is an import statement built into node.js - it reads complex files.


==================
TO DO:
==================
1. Given no updated code review, do tomorrow's lab on first two sections.
2. Once code review from Thur appears, update:
    a. Problem with database and weather, which has data not appearing at all when location queried a second time. 
    b. Add to eventbrite to make compatible with database
    c. Update schema for eventbrite
    d. Use code to prepare for friday's lab
